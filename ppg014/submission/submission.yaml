  Transverse momentum spectra of neutral pions in the range $1 < p_T < 10Gev/c$ have been measured at midrapidity by the PHENIX experiment at BNL RHIC in Au $+$ Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200\ GeV$. The $\pi^0$ multiplicity in central reactions is significantly below the yields measured at the same $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ in peripheral Au $+$ Au and $p+p$ reactions scaled by the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions. For the most central bin, the supression factor is ~2.5 at $p_T = 2GeV/c$ and increases to ~4-5 at $p_T \approx 4\ GeV/c$. At larger $p_T$, the suppression remains constant within errors. The deficit is already apparent in semiperipheral reactions and increases smoothly with centrality.

The error bars include all point-to-point experimental ($p+p, Au+Au$) errors. The shaded bands represent the fractional uncertainties in $\langle T_{AuAu} \rangle$ and in the $\pi^0$ yields normalization added in quadrature, which can move all the points up or down together (in the central case the shaded band shown is the fractional error for the first point).

description: Nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}(p_T)$ for $\pi^0$ in central (closed circles) and peripheral (open circles) $Au+Au$ at $\sqrt{S_{NN}} = 200\ GeV$. The error bars include all point-to-point experimental ($p+p, Au+Au$) errors. The shaded bands represent the fractional uncertainties in $\langle T_{AuAu} \rangle$ and in the $\pi^0$ yields normalization added in quadrature, which can move all the points up or down together (in the central case the shaded band shown is the fractional error for the first point). Systematic uncertainties which are correlated point-to-point are labeled sys(corr) and systematic uncertainties from the normalization are labeled sys(norm).

# # description: Ratio of $Au+Au$ over $p+p$ $\pi^0$ yields integrated above $4\ GeV/c$ and normalized using $\langle N_{coll} \rangle$ (circles) and $\langle N_{part} \rangle$ (crosses), as a function of centrality given by $\langle N_{part} \rangle$. The errors bands and bars are the same as for Fig. 2.
