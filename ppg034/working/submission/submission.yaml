comment: Measurements in $Au+Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200\ \mathrm{GeV}$ of jet correlations for a trigger hadron at intermediate transverse momentum ($p_{T,\ trig}$) with associated mesons or baryons at lower $p_{T,\ assoc}$ indicate strong modification of the away-side jet. The ratio of jet-associated baryons to mesons increases with centrality and $p_{T, assoc}$. For the most central collisions, the ratio is similar to that for inclusive measure- ments. This trend is incompatible with in-vacuum fragmentation but could be due to jetlike contributions from correlated soft partons, which recombine upon hadronization.
